## 📋 Overview

**Omni Health** is an integrated, intelligent medical diagnostic platform combining **Deep Learning (Computer Vision)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing (RAG)** to assist healthcare professionals in real-time clinical workflows. Built with a production-ready multi-page Streamlit interface, it delivers unified diagnostic insights across medical imaging, cardiovascular predictive metrics, and automated clinical documentation analysis.

### Key Features
* 📷 **Neural Imaging Suite**: Real-time object detection for bone fractures and multi-label classification for structural chest pathologies.
* 📊 **Predictive Analytics**: Robust risk scoring engine for chronic cardiovascular health indicators.
* ✍️ **NLP Report Assistant**: Context-aware Medical Report Analyzer utilizing generative RAG for conversational insight extraction.
* 🛡️ **Production Engineering**: Built-in failsafes for edge-case request limits, cross-device compatibility, and asynchronous session states.

## 🎯 Features & Modules

### 1. 📷 Deep Learning Detection Suite
* **Bone Fracture Localization**: Utilizes a custom **YOLOv11** architecture trained on the **FracAtlas** dataset to identify structural bone structural anomalies, generating dynamic annotated bounding boxes.
* **Chest Pathology Classification**: Leverages a **ConvNeXt Tiny** backbone targeting the **NIH Chest X-ray** dataset. It screens for 14 individual conditions (e.g., Pneumonia, Effusion, Infiltration, Cardiomegaly) simultaneously via independent multi-label sigmoidal confidence parsing.
* **Dynamic Thresholding**: Real-time adjustable sliders allow clinicians to balance sensitivity and precision constraints on the fly.

### 2. 📊 Machine Learning Risk Predictor
* **Cardiovascular Risk Framework**: Implements a high-precision **Random Forest Classifier** trained against the classic **UCI Cleveland Heart Disease** dataset.
* **Phenotypic Variable Parsing**: Evaluates incoming clinical values including blood pressure variations, cholesterol, resting electrocardiographic behaviors, and ST-segment slopes to calculate granular cardiac risk categories.

### 3. ✍️ NLP-Powered Report Analyzer (RAG)
* **Direct Context Ingestion**: Uses the massive context capability of `gemini-2.5-flash` to execute zero-loss Retrieval-Augmented Generation directly over complete medical text blocks.
* **Cross-Suite Data Handoff**: Integrates with Streamlit's global `st.session_state`. Automated computer vision findings from the imaging suite can be passed seamlessly into the RAG compiler to auto-generate reports without forcing manual uploads.
* **Double-Defense Security**: Codebase includes backend exception intercepts and frontend failsafes to gracefully catch cloud service traffic spikes (`503 UNAVAILABLE`), displaying informative user banners instead of critical script failures.

## ⚙️ Engineering Implementation Highlights

### Cross-Device & Weight Compatibility Fix
To handle cross-device compatibility (training on high-throughput CUDA clusters vs. executing local CPU client inference) and bypass modern payload constraints on legacy serialization models, the loading logic employs a secure mapping override:

```python
# From src/dl_engine.py
state_dict = torch.load(
    "models/best_model_chest.pkl", 
    map_location=torch.device('cpu'), 
    weights_only=False # Enables loading complex custom model layer architectures safely
)
```

### High-Demand Failsafe Handling
To prevent application failures during peak free-tier usage, the conversational interface wraps critical generative calls in high-defense exception frameworks:

```python
# From pages/3_✍️_Reporting.py
try:
    answer = nlp_engine.answer_question(report_content, user_query, history)
except Exception:
    answer = "⚠️ The AI service is experiencing a temporary traffic spike. Please try resubmitting your question."
```
